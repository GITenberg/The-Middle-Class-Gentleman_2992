        ACT ONE
      </h2>
      <p>
        SCENE I <i>(Music Master, Dancing Master, Musicians, and Dancers)</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>(The play opens with a great assembly of instruments, and in the
        middle of the stage is a</i> <i>pupil of the Music Master seated at a
        table composing a melody</i> <i>which Monsieur Jourdain has ordered for
        a serenade.)</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        MUSIC MASTER: <i>(To Musicians)</i> Come, come into this room, sit there
        and wait until he comes.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DANCING MASTER: <i>(To dancers)</i> And you too, on this side.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MUSIC MASTER: <i>(To Pupil)</i> Is it done?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        PUPIL: Yes.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MUSIC MASTER: Let's see. . . This is good.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DANCING MASTER: Is it something new?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MUSIC MASTER: Yes, it's a melody for a serenade that I set him to
        composing here, while waiting for our man to awake.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DANCING MASTER: May I see it?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MUSIC MASTER: You'll hear it, with the dialogue, when he comes. He won't
        be long.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DANCING MASTER: Our work, yours and mine, is not trivial at present.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MUSIC MASTER: This is true. We've found here such a man as we both need.
        This is a nice source of income for us -- this Monsieur Jourdain, with
        the visions of nobility and gallantry that he has gotten into his head.
        You and I should hope that everyone resembled him.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DANCING MASTER: Not entirely; I could wish that he understood better the
        things that we give him.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MUSIC MASTER: It's true that he understands them poorly, but he pays
        well, and that's what our art needs now more than anything else.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DANCING MASTER: As for me, I admit, I feed a little on glory. Applause
        touches me; and I hold that, in all the fine arts, it is painful to
        produce for dolts, to endure the barbarous opinions of a fool about my
        choreography. It is a pleasure, don't tell me otherwise, to work for
        people who can appreciate the fine points of an art, who know how to
        give a sweet reception to the beauties of a work and, by pleasurable
        approbations, gratify us for our labor. Yes, the most agreeable
        recompense we can receive for the things we do is to see them recognized
        and flattered by an applause that honors us. There is nothing, in my
        opinion, that pays us better for all our fatigue; and it is an exquisite
        delight to receive the praises of the well-informed.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MUSIC MASTER: I agree, and I enjoy them as you do. There is surely
        nothing more agreeable than the applause you speak of; but that incense
        does not provide a living. Pure praises do not provide a comfortable
        existence; it is necessary to add something solid, and the best way to
        praise is to praise with cash-in-hand. He's a man, it's true, whose
        insight is very slight, who talks nonsense about everything and applauds
        only for the wrong reasons but his money makes up for his judgments. He
        has discernment in his purse. His praises are in cash, and this ignorant
        bourgeois is worth more to us, as you see, than the educated nobleman
        who introduced us here.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DANCING MASTER: There is some truth in what you say; but I find that you
        lean a little too heavily on money; and material interest is something
        so base that a man of good taste should never show an attachment to it.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MUSIC MASTER: You are ready enough to receive the money our man gives
        you.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DANCING MASTER: Assuredly; but I don't place all my happiness in it, and
        I could wish that together with his fortune he had some good taste in
        things.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MUSIC MASTER: I could wish it too, that's what both of us are working
        for as much as we can. But, in any case, he gives us the means to make
        ourselves known in the world; and he will pay others if they will praise
        him.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DANCING MASTER: Here he comes.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        SCENE II <i>(Monsieur Jourdain, Two Lackeys, Music Master, Dancing
        Master, Pupil, Musicians, and Dancers)</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Well gentlemen? What's this? Are you going to show me
        your little skit?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DANCING MASTER: How? What little skit?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Well, the. . . What-do-you-call it? Your prologue or
        dialogue of songs and dances.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DANCING MASTER: Ha, ha!&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MUSIC MASTER: You find us ready for you.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: I kept you waiting a little, but it's because I'm
        having myself dressed today like the people of quality, and my tailor
        sent me some silk stockings that I thought I would never get on.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MUSIC MASTER: We are here only to wait upon your leisure.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: I want you both to stay until they have brought me my
        suit, so that you may see me.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DANCING MASTER: Whatever you would like.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: You will see me fitted out properly, from head to
        foot.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MUSIC MASTER: We have no doubt of it.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: I had this robe made for me.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DANCING MASTER: It's very attractive.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: My tailor told me the people of quality dress like
        this in the mornings.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MUSIC MASTER: It's marvelously becoming.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Hey lackeys! My two lackeys!&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        FIRST LACKEY; What do you wish, Sir?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Nothing. I just wanted to see if you were paying
        attention. <i>(To the two masters)</i> What say you of my liveries?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DANCING MASTER: They're magnificent.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: <i>(Half opening his gown, showing a pair</i> <i>of
        tight red velvet breeches, and a green velvet vest, that he</i> <i>is
        wearing) </i>Here again is a sort of lounging dress to perform my
        morning exercises in.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MUSIC MASTER: It is elegant.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Lackey!&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        FIRST LACKEY: Sir?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: The other lackey!&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        SECOND LACKEY: Sir?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Hold my robe.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>(To the Masters)</i> Do you think I look good?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DANCING MASTER: Very well. No one could look better.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Now let's have a look at your little show.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MUSIC MASTER: I would like very much for you to listen to a melody he <i>(indicating
        his student)</i> has just composed for the serenade that you ordered
        from me. He's one of my pupils who has an admirable talent for these
        kinds of things.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Yes, but you should not have had that done by a
        pupil; you yourself were none too good for that piece of work.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MUSIC MASTER: You must not let the name of pupil fool you, sir. Pupils
        of this sort know as much as the greatest masters, and the melody is as
        fine as could be made. Just listen.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: <i>(To Lackeys)</i> Give me my robe so I can listen
        better . . . Wait, I believe I would be better without a robe. . . No,
        give it back, that will be better.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MUSICIAN: <i>(Singing)</i> <i>I languish night and day, my suffering is
        extreme</i> <i>Since to your control your lovely eyes subjected me;</i>
        <i>If you thus treat, fair Iris, those you love,</i> <i>Alas, how would
        you treat an enemy?</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: This song seems to me a little mournful, it lulls to
        sleep, and I would like it if you could liven it up a little, here and
        there.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MUSIC MASTER: It is necessary, Sir, that the tune be suited to the
        words.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Someone taught me a perfectly pretty one some time
        ago. Listen . . . Now . . . how does it go?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DANCING MASTER: By my faith, I don't know.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: There are sheep in it.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DANCING MASTER: Sheep?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Yes. Ah! <i>(He sings)</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>I thought my Jeanneton</i> <i>As beautiful as sweet;</i> <i>I thought
        my Janneton</i> <i>Far sweeter than a sheep.</i> <i>Alas! Alas! She is a
        hundred times,</i> <i>A thousand times, more cruel</i> <i>Than tigers in
        the woods!</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        Isn't it pretty?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MUSIC MASTER: The prettiest in the world.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DANCING MASTER: And you sing it well.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: It's without having learned music.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MUSIC MASTER: You ought to learn it, Sir, as you are learning dancing.
        They are two arts which have a close connection.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DANCING MASTER: And which open the mind of a man to fine things.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: And do people of quality learn music, too?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MUSIC MASTER: Yes sir.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: I'll learn it then. But I don't know when I can find
        time; for besides the Fencing Master who's teaching me, I have also
        engaged a master of philosophy who is to begin this morning.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MUSIC MASTER: Philosophy is something; but music, sir, music . . .&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DANCING MASTER: Music and dancing, music and dancing, that's all that's
        necessary.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MUSIC MASTER: There's nothing so useful in a State as music.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DANCING MASTER: There's nothing so necessary to men as dancing.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MUSIC MASTER: Without music, a State cannot subsist.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DANCING MASTER: Without the dance, a man can do nothing.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MUSIC MASTER: All the disorders, all the wars one sees in the world
        happen only from not learning music.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DANCING MASTER: All the misfortunes of mankind, all the dreadful
        disasters that fill the history books, the blunders of politicians and
        the faults of omission of great commanders, all this comes from not
        knowing how to dance.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: How is that?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MUSIC MASTER: Does not war result from a lack of agreement between men?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: That is true.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MUSIC MASTER: And if all men learned music, wouldn't that be a means of
        bringing about harmony and of seeing universal peace in the world?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: You are right.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DANCING MASTER: When a man has committed a mistake in his conduct, in
        family affairs, or in affairs of government of a state, or in the
        command of an army, do we not always say, "He took a bad step in such
        and such an affair?"&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Yes, that's said.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DANCING MASTER: And can taking a bad step result from anything but not
        knowing how to dance?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: It's true, you are both right.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DANCING MASTER: It makes you see the excellence and usefulness of music
        and the dance.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: I understand that, now.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MUSIC MASTER: Do you wish to see our pieces?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Yes.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MUSIC MASTER: I have already told you that this is a little attempt I
        have made to show the different passions that music can express.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Very good.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MUSIC MASTER <i>(To musicians)</i> Here, come forward<i>. (To Monsieur</i>
        <i>Jourdain)</i> You must imagine that they are dressed as shepherds.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Why always as shepherds? You see nothing but that
        everywhere.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MUSIC MASTER: When we have characters that are to speak in music, it's
        necessary, for believability, to make them pastoral. Singing has always
        been assigned to shepherds; and it is scarcely natural dialogue for
        princes or merchants to sing their passions.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Alright, alright. Let's see.&nbsp;

      <p>
        DIALOGUE IN MUSIC: <i>(A Woman and Two Men)</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        ALL THREE: <i>A heart, under the domination of love,</i> <i>Is always
        with a thousand cares oppressed.</i> <i>It is said that we gladly
        languish, gladly sigh;</i> <i>But, despite what can be said,</i> <i>There
        is nothing so sweet as our liberty!</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        FIRST MAN: <i>There is nothing so sweet as the loving fires</i> <i>That
        make two hearts beat as one.</i> <i>One cannot live without amorous
        desires;</i> <i>Take love from life, you take away the pleasures.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        SECOND MAN: <i>It would be sweet to submit to love's rule,</i> <i>If one
        could find faithful love,</i> <i>But, alas! oh cruel rule!</i> <i>No
        faithful shepherdess is to be seen,</i> <i>And that inconstant sex, much
        too unworthy,</i> <i>Must renounce love eternally.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        FIRST MAN: <i>Pleasing ardor!</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        WOMAN: <i>Happy liberty!</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        SECOND MAN: <i>Deceitful woman!</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        FIRST MAN: <i>How precious you are to me!</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        WOMAN: <i>How you please my heart!</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        SECOND MAN: <i>How horrible you are to me!</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        FIRST MAN: <i>Ah, leave, for love, that mortal hate!</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        WOMAN: <i>We can, we can show you</i> <i>a faithful shepherdess!</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        SECOND MAN: <i>Alas! Where to find her?</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        WOMAN: <i>In order to defend our reputation,</i> <i>I want to offer you
        my heart!</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        FIRST MAN: <i>But, shepherdess, can I believe</i> <i>That it will not be
        deceitful?</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        WOMAN: <i>We'll see through experience,</i> <i>Who of the two loves
        best.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        SECOND MAN: <i>Who lacks constancy,</i> <i>May the gods destroy!</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        ALL THREE: <i>With ardors so beautiful</i> <i>Let us be inflamed!</i> <i>Ah,
        how sweet it is to love,</i> <i>When two hearts are faithful!</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Is that all?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MUSIC MASTER: Yes.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: I find it well-done, and there are some pretty enough
        sayings in it.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DANCING MASTER: Here, for my presentation, is a little display of the
        loveliest movements and the most beautiful attitudes with which a dance
        can possibly be varied.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Are these shepherds too?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DANCING MASTER: They're whatever you please. Let's go!&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>(Four dancers execute all the different movements and all the kinds
        of steps that the Dancing Master</i> <i>commands; and this dance makes
        the First Interlude.)</i>&nbsp;<i>&nbsp;</i> <br /> <br />

      <p>
        SCENE I <i>(Monsieur Jourdain, Music Master, Dancing Master, Lackeys)</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: That's not all that bad, and those people there hop
        around well.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MUSIC MASTER: When the dance is combined with the music, it will have
        even better effect, and you will see something quite good in the little
        ballet we have prepared for you.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: That's for later, when the person I ordered all this
        for is to do me the honor of coming here to dine.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DANCING MASTER: Everything is ready.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MUSIC MASTER: However, sir, this is not enough. A person like you, who
        lives magnificently, and who are inclined towards fine things, should
        have a concert of music here every Wednesday or every Thursday.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Is that what people of quality do?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MUSIC MASTER: Yes, Sir.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Then I'll have them. Will it be fine?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MUSIC MASTER: Without doubt. You must have three voices-- a tenor, a
        soprano, and a bass, who will be accompanied by a bass-viol, a theorbo,
        and a clavecin for the chords, with two violins to play the
        ritournelles.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: You must also add a trumpet marine. The trumpet
        marine is an instrument that pleases me and it's harmonious.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MUSIC MASTER: Leave it to us to manage things.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: At least, don't forget to send the musicians to sing
        at table.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MUSIC MASTER: You will have everything you should have.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: But above all, let the ballet be fine.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MUSIC MASTER: You will be pleased with it, and, among other things, with
        certain minuets you will find in it.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Ah! Minuets are my dance, and I would like you to see
        me dance them. Come, my Dancing Master.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DANCING MASTER: A hat, sir, if you please. La, la, la, la. La, la, la,
        la. In cadence please. La, la, la, la. Your right leg. La, la, la, la.
        Don't move your shoulders so. La, la, la, la. Your arms are wrong. La,
        la, la, la. Raise your head. Turn the toe out. La, la, la, la.
        Straighten your body up.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: How was that? <i>(Breathlessly)</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        MUSIC MASTER: The best.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: By the way, teach me how to bow to salute a
        marchioness; I shall need to know soon.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DANCING MASTER: How you must bow to salute a marchioness?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Yes, a marchioness named Dorim&egrave;ne.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DANCING MASTER: Give me your hand.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: No. You only have to do it, I'll remember it well.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DANCING MASTER: If you want to salute her with a great deal of respect,
        you must first bow and step back, then bow three times as you walk
        towards her, and at the last one bow down to her knees.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: <i>(After the Dancing Master has illustrated)</i> Do
        it some. Good!&nbsp;

      <p>
        LACKEY: Sir, your Fencing Master is here.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Tell him to come in here for my lesson. I want you to
        see me perform.&nbsp;

      <p>
        SCENE II <i>(Fencing Master, Music Master, Dancing Master, Monsier
        Jourdain, a Lackey)</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        FENCING MASTER: <i>(After giving a foil to Monsieur Jourdain)</i> Come,
        sir, the salute. Your body straight. A little inclined upon the left
        thigh. Your legs not so wide apart. Your feet both in a line. Your wrist
        opposite your hip. The point of your sword even with your shoulder. The
        arm not so much extended. The left hand at the level of the eye. The
        left shoulder more squared. The head up. The expression bold. Advance.
        The body steady. Beat carte, and thrust. One, two. Recover. Again, with
        the foot firm. Leap back. When you make a pass, Sir, you must first
        disengage, and your body must be well turned. One, two. Come, beat
        tierce and thrust. Advance. Stop there. One, two. Recover. Repeat. Leap
        back. On guard, Sir, on guard. <i>(The fencing master touches him two or
        three times with</i> <i>the foil while saying, "On guard." )</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: How was that? <i>(Breathlessly)</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        MUSIC MASTER: You did marvelously!&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        FENCING MASTER: As I have told you, the entire secret of fencing lies in
        two things: to give and not to receive; and as I demonstrated to you the
        other day, it is impossible for you to receive, if you know how to turn
        your opponent's sword from the line of your body. This depends solely on
        a slight movement of the wrist, either inward or outward.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: In this way then, a man, without courage, is sure to
        kill his man and not be killed himself?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        FENCING MASTER: Without doubt. Didn't you see the demonstration?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Yes.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        FENCING MASTER: And thus you have seen how men like me should be
        considered by the State, and how the science of fencing is more
        important than all the other useless sciences, such as dancing, music,
        ...&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DANCING MASTER: Careful there, Monsieur swordsman! Speak of the dance
        only with respect.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MUSIC MASTER: I beg you to speak better of the excellence of music.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        FENCING MASTER: You are amusing fellows, to want to compare your
        sciences with mine!&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MUSIC MASTER: See the self-importance of the man!&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        FENCING MASTER: My little Dancing Master, I'll make you dance as you
        ought. And you, my little musician, I'll make you sing in a pretty way.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DANCING MASTER: Monsieur Clanger-of-iron, I'll teach you your trade.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: <i>(To the Dancing Master)</i> Are you crazy to
        quarrel with him, who knows tierce and quarte, and who can kill a man by
        demonstration?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DANCING MASTER: I disdain his demonstrations, and his tierce, and his
        quarte.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Careful, I tell you.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        FENCING MASTER: What? You little impertinent!&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Oh! My Fencing Master.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DANCING MASTER: What? You big workhorse!&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Oh! My Dancing Master.&nbsp;
      </p>

        FENCING MASTER: If I throw myself on you ...&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Careful.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>

      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Be nice!&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        FENCING MASTER: I'll go over you with a curry-comb, in such a way...&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Mercy!&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DANCING MASTER: I'll give you a beating such as ...&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: I beg of you!&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MUSIC MASTER: Let us teach him a little how to talk!&nbsp;

        SCENE III <i>(Philosophy Master, Music Master, Dancing Master, Fencing
        Master, Monsieur Jourdain, Lackeys)</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Aha! Monsieur Philosopher, you come just in time with
        your philosophy. Come, make a little peace among these people.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        PHILOSOPHY MASTER: What's happening? What's the matter, gentlemen.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: They have got into a rage over the superiority of
        their professions to the point of injurious words and of wanting to come
        to blows.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        PHILOSOPHY MASTER: What! Gentlemen, must you act this way? Haven't you
        read the learned treatise that Seneca composed on anger? Is there
        anything more base and more shameful than this passion, which turns a
        man into a savage beast? And shouldn't reason be the mistress of all our
        activities?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DANCING MASTER: Well! Sir, he has just abused both of us by, despising
        the dance, which I practice, and music, which is his profession.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        PHILOSOPHY MASTER: A wise man is above all the insults that can be
        spoken to him; and the grand reply one should make to such outrages is
        moderation and patience.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        FENCING MASTER: They both had the audacity of trying to compare their
        professions with mine.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        PHILOSOPHY MASTER: Should that disturb you? Men should not dispute
        amongst themselves about vainglory and rank; that which perfectly
        distinguishes one from the other is wisdom and virtue.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DANCING MASTER: I insist to him that dance is a science to which one
        cannot do enough honor.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MUSIC MASTER: And I, that music is something that all the ages have
        revered.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        FENCING MASTER: And I insist to them that the science of fencing is the
        finest and the most necessary of all sciences.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        PHILOSOPHY MASTER: And where then will philosophy be? I find you all
        very impertinent to speak with this arrogance in front of me, and
        impudently to give the name of science to things that one should not
        even honor with the name of art, and that cannot be classified except
        under the name of miserable gladiator, singer, and buffoon!&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        FENCING MASTER: Get out, you dog of a philosopher!&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MUSIC MASTER: Get out, you worthless pedant!&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DANCING MASTER: Get out, you ill-mannered cur!&nbsp;
      </p>

        flings himself at them, and all three go out fighting)</i>.&nbsp;

        Philosopher! Gentlemen! Monsieur Philosopher! Oh! Fight as much as you
        like. I don't know what to do, and I'll not spoil my robe to separate
        you. I would be a fool to go among them and receive some damaging blow.&nbsp;

      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Oh! Sir, I am distressed by the blows they gave you.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        PHILOSOPHY MASTER: It's nothing. A philosopher knows how to take these
        things and I'll compose a satire against them, in the style of Juvenal,
        which will fix them nicely. Let it be. What would you like to learn?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Everything I can, for I have every desire in the
        world to be educated, and I'm furious that my father and mother did not
        make me study all the sciences when I was young.&nbsp;
      </p>

        PHILOSOPHY MASTER: This is a reasonable sentiment. Nam sine doctrina
        vita est quasi mortis imago. You understand that, and you doubtless know
        Latin?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Yes, but act as if I did not know it. Tell me what it
        says.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        PHILOSOPHY MASTER: It says that without science life is almost an image
        of death.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: That Latin is right.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        PHILOSOPHY MASTER: Don't you know some principles, some basics of the
        sciences?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Oh yes! I can read and write.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        PHILOSOPHY MASTER: Where would it please you for us to begin? Would you
        like me to teach you logic?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: What is this logic?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        PHILOSOPHY MASTER: It is that which teaches the three operations of the
        mind.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: What are these three operations of the mind?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        PHILOSOPHY MASTER: The first, the second, and the third. The first is to
        conceive well by means of the universals; the second is to judge well by
        means of the categories; and the third is to draw well a conclusion by
        means of figures. Barbara, Celarent, Darii, Ferio, Baralipton, etc.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Those words are too ugly. This logic doesn't suit me
        at all. Let's learn something else that's prettier.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        PHILOSOPHY MASTER: Would you like to learn morality?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Morality?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        PHILOSOPHY MASTER: Yes.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: What does it say, this morality?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        PHILOSOPHY MASTER: It treats of happiness, teaches men to moderate their
        passions, and ...&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: No, let's leave that. I'm as choleric as all the
        devils and there's no morality that sticks, I want to be as full of
        anger as I want whenever I like.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        PHILOSOPHY MASTER: Would you like to learn physics?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: What's it about, this physics?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        PHILOSOPHY MASTER: Physics explains the principles of natural things and
        the properties of the material world; it discourses on the nature of the
        elements, of metals, minerals, of stones, of plants and animals, and
        teaches the causes of all the meteors, the rainbow, the will o' the
        wisps, the comets, lightning, thunder, thunderbolts, rain, snow, hail,
        winds, and whirlwinds.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: There's too much commotion in it, too much confusion.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        PHILOSOPHY MASTER: Then what do you want me to teach you?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Teach me how to spell.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        PHILOSOPHY MASTER: Very gladly.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Afterwards, you may teach me the almanack, to know
        when there is a moon and when not.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        PHILOSOPHY MASTER: So be it. Following your thought and treating this
        matter as a philosopher, it is necessary to begin according to the order
        of things, by an exact knowledge of the nature of letters and the
        different ways of pronouncing them all. And thereupon I must tell you
        letters are divided into vowels, called vowels because they express the
        voice; and into consonants because they sound with the vowels and only
        mark the diverse articulations of the voice. There are five vowels or
        voices: A, E, I, O, U.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: I understand all that.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        PHILOSOPHY MASTER: The vowel A is formed by opening the mouth widely :
        A. Its vowels are to be given the sounds used in vocalizing:
        Ah-aye-ee-o-ou.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: A, A. Yes.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        PHILOSOPHY MASTER: The vowel E is formed by approaching the lower jaw to
        the upper: A, E.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: A, E; A, E. By my faith, yes. Ah! How fine!&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        PHILOSOPHY MASTER: And the vowel I, by bringing the jaws still nearer
        each other and stretching the two corners of the mouth towards the ears:
        A, E, I.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: A, E, I. I. I. I. That's true. Long live science!&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        PHILOSOPHY MASTER: The vowel O is formed by opening the jaws and drawing
        together the two corners of the lips, upper and lower: O.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: O, O. There's nothing truer. A, E, I, O,I, O...
        That's admirable! I, O, I, O.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        PHILOSOPHY MASTER: The opening of the mouth happens to make a little
        circle which represents an O.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: O, O, O. You are right! O. Ah! What a fine thing it
        is to know something!&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        PHILOSOPHY MASTER: The vowel U is formed by bringing the teeth nearly
        together without completely joining them, and thrusting the two lips
        outward, also bringing them nearly together without completely joining
        them: U.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: U, U. There's nothing truer. U.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        PHILOSOPHY MASTER: Your two lips thrust out as if you were making a
        face, whence it results that if you want to make a face at someone and
        mock him, you have only to say to him "U."&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: U, U. That's true. Ah! Why didn't I study sooner in
        order to know all that!&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        PHILOSOPHY MASTER: Tomorrow we shall look at the other letters, which
        are the consonants.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Are there things as curious about them as about
        these?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        PHILOSOPHY MASTER: Without a doubt. The consonant D, for example, is
        pronounced by clapping the tongue above the upper teeth: D.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: D, D, Yes. Ah! What fine things! Fine things!&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        PHILOSOPHY MASTER: The F, by pressing the upper teeth against the lower
        lip: F.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: F, F. That's the truth. Ah! My father and my mother,
        how I wish you ill!&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        PHILOSOPHY MASTER: And the R, by carrying the tip of the tongue to the
        top of the palate, so that being grazed by the air that comes out with
        force, it yields to it and comes back always to the same place, making a
        kind of trill: R. AR.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: R, R, AR. R, R, R, R, R, RA. That's true. Ah! What a
        clever man you are! And how I have lost time! R, R, R, AR.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        PHILOSOPHY MASTER: I'll explain to you all these strange things to their
        very depths.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Please do. But now, I must confide in you. I'm in
        love with a lady of great quality, and I wish that you would help me
        write something to her in a little note that I will let fall at her
        feet.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        PHILOSOPHY MASTER: Very well.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: That will be gallant, yes?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        PHILOSOPHY MASTER: Without doubt. Is it verse that you wish to write
        her?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: No, no. No verse.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        PHILOSOPHY MASTER: Do you want only prose?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: No, I don't want either prose or verse.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        PHILOSOPHY MASTER: It must be one or the other.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Why?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        PHILOSOPHY MASTER: Because, sir, there is no other way to express
        oneself than with prose or verse.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: There is nothing but prose or verse?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        PHILOSOPHY MASTER: No, sir, everything that is not prose is verse, and
        everything that is not verse is prose.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: And when one speaks, what is that then?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        PHILOSOPHY MASTER: Prose.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: What! When I say, "Nicole, bring me my slippers, and
        give me my nightcap," that's prose?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        PHILOSOPHY MASTER: Yes, Sir.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: By my faith! For more than forty years I have been
        speaking prose without knowing anything about it, and I am much obliged
        to you for having taught me that. I would like then to put into a note
        to her: "Beautiful marchioness, your lovely eyes make me die of love,"
        but I want that put in a gallant manner and be nicely turned.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        PHILOSOPHY MASTER: Put it that the fires of her eyes reduce your heart
        to cinders; that you suffer night and day for her the torments of a . .
        .&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: No, no, no. I want none of that; I only want you to
        say "Beautiful marchioness, your lovely eyes make me die of love."&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        PHILOSOPHY MASTER: The thing requires a little lengthening.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: No, I tell you, I want only those words in the note,
        but turned stylishly, well arranged, as is necessary. Please tell me,
        just to see, the diverse ways they could be put.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        PHILOSOPHY MASTER: One could put them first of all as you said them:
        "Beautiful marchioness, your lovely eyes make me die of love." Or else:
        "Of love to die make me, beautiful marchioness, your beautiful eyes." Or
        else: "Your lovely eyes, of love make me, beautiful marchioness, die."
        Or else: "Die, your lovely eyes, beautiful marchioness, of love make
        me." Or else: "Me make your lovely eyes die, beautiful marchioness, of
        love."&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: But, of all those ways, which is the best?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        PHILOSOPHY MASTER: The way you said it: "Beautiful marchioness, your
        lovely eyes make me die of love."&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: I never studied, and yet I made the whole thing up at
        the first try. I thank you with all my heart, and I ask you to come
        tomorrow early.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        PHILOSOPHY MASTER: I shall not fail to do so. <i>(He leaves).</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: What? Hasn't my suit come yet?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        THE LACKEY: No, Sir.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: That cursed tailor makes me wait all day when I have
        so much to do! I'm enraged. May the quartan fever shake that tormentor
        of a tailor! To the devil with the tailor! May the plague choke the
        tailor! If I had him here now, that detestable tailor, that dog of a
        tailor, that traitor of a tailor, I . . .&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        SCENE V <i>(Master Tailor, Apprentice Tailor carrying suit, Monsieur
        Jourdain, Lackeys)</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Ah! You're here! I was getting into a rage against
        you.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MASTER TAILOR: I could not come sooner, and I put twenty men to work on
        your suit.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: You sent me some silk hose so small that I had all
        the difficulty in the world putting them on, and already there are two
        broken stitches.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MASTER TAILOR: They get bigger, too much so.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Yes, if I always break the stitches. You also had
        made for me a pair of shoes that pinch furiously.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MASTER TAILOR: Not at all, sir.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: How, not at all!&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MASTER TAILOR: No, they don't pinch you at all.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: I tell you, they pinch me.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MASTER TAILOR: You imagine that.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: I imagine it because I feel it. That's a good reason
        for you!&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MASTER TAILOR: Wait, here is the finest court-suit, and the best
        matched. It's a masterpiece to have invented a serious suit that is not
        black. And I give six attempts to the best tailors to equal it.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: What's this? You've put the flowers upside down.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MASTER TAILOR: You didn't tell me you wanted them right side up.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Did I have to tell you that?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MASTER TAILOR: Yes, surely. All the people of quality wear them this
        way.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: The people of quality wear the flowers upside down?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MASTER TAILOR: Yes, Sir.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Oh! It's alright then.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MASTER TAILOR: If you like, I'll put them right side up.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: No, no.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MASTER TAILOR: You have only to say so.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: No, I tell you. You've made it very well. Do you
        think the suit is going to look good on me?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MASTER TAILOR: What a question! I defy a painter with his brush to do
        anything that would fit you better. I have a worker in my place who is
        the greatest genius in the world at mounting a rhinegrave, and another
        who is the hero of the age at assembling a doublet.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: The perruque and the plumes: are they correct?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MASTER TAILOR: Everything's good.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: <i>(Looking at the tailor's suit)</i> Ah! Ah!
        Monsieur Tailor, here's the material from the last suit you made for me.
        I know it well.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MASTER TAILOR: You see, the material seemed so fine that I wanted a suit
        made of it for myself.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Yes, but you should not have cut it out of mine.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MASTER TAILOR: Do you want to put on your suit?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Yes, give it to me.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MASTER TAILOR: Wait. That's not the way it's done. I have brought men to
        dress you in a cadence; these kinds of suits are put on with ceremony.
        Hey there! Come in, you! Put this suit on the gentleman the way you do
        with people of quality.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>(Four APPRENTICE TAILORS enter, two of them pull off Monsieur</i> <i>Jourdain's
        breeches made for his morning</i> <i>exercises, and two others pull off
        his waistcoat; then they</i> <i>put on his new suit; Monsieur</i> <i>Jourdain
        promenades among them and shows them his suit for their approval. All
        this to the cadence of instrumental music.)</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        APPRENTICE TAILOR: My dear gentleman, please to give the apprentices a
        small tip.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: What did you call me?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        APPRENTICE TAILOR: My dear gentleman.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: My dear gentleman! That's what it is to dress like
        people of quality! Go all your life dressed like a bourgeois and they'll
        never call you "My dear gentleman." Here, take this for the "My dear
        gentleman."&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        APPRENTICE TAILOR: My Lord, we are very much obliged to you.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: "My Lord!" Oh! Oh! "My Lord!" Wait, my friend. "My
        Lord" deserves something, and it's not a little word, this "My Lord."
        Take this. That's what "My Lord" gives you.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        APPRENTICE TAILOR: My Lord, we will drink to the health of Your Grace.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: "Your Grace!" Oh! Oh! Oh! Wait, don't go. To me,
        "Your Grace!" My faith, if he goes as far as "Highness," he will have
        all my purse. Wait. That's for "My Grace."&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        APPRENTICE TAILOR: My Lord, we thank you very humbly for your
        liberality.&nbsp;

        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Follow me, I am going to show off my clothes a little
        about town. And above all both of you take care to walk close at my
        heels, so people can see that you are with me.&nbsp;
      </p>

        LACKEYS: Yes, Sir.&nbsp;

      </p>
      <p>
        NICOLE: Yes, sir?
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Listen.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        NICOLE: He, he, he, he, he!&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: What are you laughing about?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        NICOLE: He, he, he, he, he, he!&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: What does the hussy mean by this?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        NICOLE: He, he, he! Oh, how you are got up! He, he, he!&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: How's that?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        NICOLE: Ah! Ah! Oh Lord! He, he, he, he, he!&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: What kind of little baggage is this? Are you mocking
        me?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        NICOLE: Certainly not, sir, I should be very sorry to do so. He, he, he,
        he, he!&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: I'll give you a smack on the nose if you go on
        laughing.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        NICOLE: Sir, I can't help it. He, he, he, he, he, he!&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: You are not going to stop?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        NICOLE: Sir, I beg pardon. But you are so funny that I couldn't help
        laughing. He, he, he!&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: What insolence!&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        NICOLE: You're so funny like that. He, he!&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: I'll . . .&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        NICOLE: Please excuse me. He, he, he, he!&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Listen. If you go on laughing the least bit, I swear
        I'll give you the biggest slap ever given.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        NICOLE: Alright, sir, it's done, I won't laugh any more.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Take good care not to. Presently you must clean . . .&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        NICOLE: He, he!&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: You must clean . . .&nbsp;

        NICOLE: He, he!&nbsp;

      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: You must, I say, clean the room and . . .&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        NICOLE: He, he!&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Again!&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        NICOLE: <i>(Falling down with laughter)</i> Then beat me sir, and let me
        have my laugh out, it will do me more good. He, he, he, he, he!&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: I'm furious.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        NICOLE: Have mercy, sir! I beg you to let me laugh. He, he, he!&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: If I catch you . . .&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        NICOLE: Sir! I shall burst . . . Oh! if I don't laugh. He, he, he!&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: But did anyone ever see such a hussy as that, who
        laughs in my face instead of receiving my, orders?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        NICOLE: What would you have me do, sir?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: That you consider getting my house ready for the
        company that's coming soon, you hussy.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        NICOLE: Ah, by my faith, I don't feel like laughing any more. All your
        guests make such a disorder here that the word "company" is enough to
        put me in a bad humor.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Why, should I shut my door to everyone for your sake?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        NICOLE: You should at least shut it to some people.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        SCENE III <i>(Madame Jourdain, Monsieur Jourdain, Nicole, Lackeys)</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        MADAME JOURDAIN: Ah, ah! Here's a new story! What's this, what's this,
        husband, this outfit you have on there? Don't you care what people think
        of you when you are got up like that? And do you want yourself laughed
        at everywhere?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: None but fools and dolts will laugh at me wife.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MADAME JOURDAIN: Truly, they haven't waited until now, your antics have
        long given a laugh to everyone.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Who's everyone, if you please?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MADAME JOURDAIN: Everyone is everyone who is right and who is wiser than
        you. For my part, I am scandalized at the life you lead. I no longer
        recognize our house. One would say it's the beginning of Carnival here,
        every day; and beginning early in the morning, so it won't be forgotten,
        one hears nothing but the racket of fiddles and singers which disturbs
        the whole neighborhood.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        NICOLE: Madame speaks well. I'll never be able to get my housework done
        properly with that gang you have come here. They have feet that hunt for
        mud in every part of town to bring it here; and poor Fran&ccedil;oise
        almost has her teeth on the floor, scrubbing the boards that your fine
        masters come to dirty up every day.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: What, our servant Nicole, you have quite a tongue for
        a peasant.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MADAME JOURDAIN: Nicole is right, and she has more sense than you. I'd
        like to know what you think you're going to do with a Dancing Master, at
        your age?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        NICOLE: And with a hulking Fencing Master who comes stamping his feet,
        shaking the whole house and tearing up all the floorboards in our
        drawing-room.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Be quiet, both servant and wife!&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MADAME JOURDAIN: Is it that you're learning to dance for the time when
        you'll have no legs to dance on?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        NICOLE: Do you want to kill someone?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Quiet, I tell you! You are ignorant women, both of
        you, and you don't know the advantages of all this.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MADAME JOURDAIN: You should instead be thinking of marrying off your
        daughter, who is of an age to be provided for.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: I'll think of marrying off my daughter when a
        suitable match comes along, but I also want to learn about fine things.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        NICOLE: I heard said, Madame, that today he took a Philosophy Master to
        thicken the soup!&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Very well. I have a wish to have wit and to reason
        about things with decent people.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MADAME JOURDAIN: Don't you intend, one of these days, to go to school
        and have yourself whipped at your age?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Why not? Would to God I were whipped this minute in
        front of everyone, if I only knew what they learn at school!&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        NICOLE: Yes, my faith! That would get you into better shape.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Without doubt.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MADAME JOURDAIN: All this is very important to the management of your
        house.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Assuredly. You both talk like beasts, and I'm ashamed
        of your ignorance. For example, do you know what are you speaking just
        now?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MADAME JOURDAIN: Yes, I know that what I'm saying is well said and that
        you ought to be considering living in another way.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: I'm not talking about that. I'm asking if you know
        what the words are that you are saying here?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MADAME JOURDAIN: They are words that are very sensible, and your conduct
        is scarcely so.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: I'm not talking about that, I tell you. I'm asking
        you: what is it that I'm speaking to you this minute, what is it?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MADAME JOURDAIN: Nonsense.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: No, no! That's not it. What is it we are both saying,
        what language is it that we are speaking right now?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MADAME JOURDAIN: Well?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: What is it called?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MADAME JOURDAIN: It's called whatever you want.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: It's prose, you ignorant creature.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MADAME JOURDAIN: Prose?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Yes, prose. Everything is prose that is not verse;
        and everything that's not verse is prose. There! This is what it is to
        study! And you <i>(to Nicole)</i>, do you know what you must do to say
        U?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        NICOLE: What?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Say U, in order to see.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        NICOLE: Oh Well, U.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: What do you do?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        NICOLE: I say U.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Yes, but, when you say U, what do you do?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        NICOLE: I do what you tell me to.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Oh, how strange it is to have to deal with morons!
        You thrust your lips out and bring your lower jaw to your upper jaw: U,
        see? U. Do you see? I make a pout: U.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        NICOLE: Yes, that's beautiful.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MADAME JOURDAIN: How admirable.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: But it's quite another thing, if you have seen O, and
        D, D, and F, F.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MADAME JOURDAIN: What is all this rigmarole?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        NICOLE: What does all this do for us?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: It enrages me when I see these ignorant women.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MADAME JOURDAIN: Go, go, you ought to send all those people packing with
        their foolishness.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        NICOLE: And above all, that great gawk of a Fencing Master, who ruins
        all my work with dust.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Well! This Fencing Master seems to get under your
        skin. I'll soon show you how impertinent you are<i>.(He has the</i> <i>foils
        brought and gives one to Nicole).</i> There. Demonstration: The line of
        the body. When your opponent thrusts in quarte, you need only do this,
        and when they thrust in tierce, you need only do this. That is the way
        never to be killed, and isn't it fine to be assured of what one does,
        when fighting against someone? There, thrust at me a little, to see.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        NICOLE: Well then, what? <i>(Nicole thrusts, giving him several</i> <i>hits).</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Easy! Wait! Oh! Gently! Devil take the hussy!&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        NICOLE: You told me to thrust.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Yes, but you thrust in tierce, before you thrust in
        quarte, and you didn't have the patience to let me parry.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MADAME JOURDAIN: You are a fool, husband, with all your fantasies, and
        this has come to you since you took a notion to associate with the
        nobility.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: When I associate with the nobility, I show my good
        judgment; and that's better than associating with your shopkeepers.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MADAME JOURDAIN: Oh yes, truly! There's a great deal to gain by
        consorting with your nobles, and you did so well with your fine Count
        you were so taken with!&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Peace! Think what you're saying. You know very well,
        wife, that you don't know who you're talking about, when you talk about
        him! He's a more important person than you think: a great Lord,
        respected at court, and who talks to the King just as I talk to you. Is
        it not a thing which does me great honor, that a person of this quality
        is seen to come so often to my house, who calls me his dear friend and
        treats me as if I were his equal? He has more regard for me than one
        would ever imagine; and, in front of everyone, he shows me so much
        affection that I am embarrassed myself.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MADAME JOURDAIN: Yes, he has a kindness for you, and shows his
        affection, but he borrows your money.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: So! Isn't it an honor for me to lend money to a man
        of that condition? And can I do less for a lord who calls me his dear
        friend?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MADAME JOURDAIN: And this lord, what does he do for you?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Things that would astonish you if you knew them.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MADAME JOURDAIN: Like what?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Blast! I cannot explain myself. It must suffice that
        if I have lent him money, he'll pay it back fully, and before long.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MADAME JOURDAIN: Yes. You are waiting for that.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Assuredly. Didn't he tell me so?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MADAME JOURDAIN: Yes, yes, he won't fail to do it.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: He swore it on the faith of a gentleman.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MADAME JOURDAIN: Nonsense!&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Well! You are very obstinate, wife. I tell you he
        will keep his word, I'm sure of it.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MADAME JOURDAIN: And I'm sure he will not, and that all his show of
        affection is only to flatter you.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Be still. Here he is.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MADAME JOURDAIN: That's all we needed! He's come again perhaps to borrow
        something from you. The very sight of him spoils my appetite.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Be still, I tell you.&nbsp;
      </p>

        SCENE IV <i>(Count Dorante, Monsieur Jourdain, Madame Jourdain, Nicole)</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        DORANTE: My dear friend, Monsieur Jourdain, how do you do?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Very well, sir, to render you my small services.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DORANTE: And Madame Jourdain there, how is she?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MADAME JOURDAIN: Madame Jourdain is as well as she can be.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DORANTE: Well! Monsieur Jourdain, you are excellently well dressed!&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: You see.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DORANTE: You have a fine air in that suit, and we have no young men at
        court who are better made than you.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Well! well!&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MADAME JOURDAIN: <i>(Aside)</i> He scratches him where it itches.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DORANTE: Turn around. It's positively elegant.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MADAME JOURDAIN: <i>(Aside)</i> Yes, as big a fool behind as in front.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DORANTE: My faith, Monsieur Jourdain, I was strangely impatient to see
        you. You are the man in the world I esteem most, and I was speaking of
        you again this morning in the bedchamber of the King.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: You do me great honor, sir. <i>(To Madame Jourdain)</i>
        In the King's bedchamber!&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DORANTE: Come, put on . . .&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Sir, I know the respect I owe you.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DORANTE: Heavens! Put on your hat; I pray you, no ceremony between us.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Sir . . .&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DORANTE: Put it on, I tell you, Monsieur Jourdain: you are my friend.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Sir, I am your humble servant.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DORANTE: I won't be covered if you won't.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: <i>(Putting on his hat) </i>I would rather be uncivil
        than troublesome.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DORANTE: I am in your debt, as you know.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MADAME JOURDAIN: Yes, we know it all too well.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DORANTE: You have generously lent me money upon several occasions, and
        you have obliged me with the best grace in the world, assuredly.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Sir, you jest with me.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DORANTE: But I know how to repay what is lent me, and to acknowledge the
        favors rendered me.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: I have no doubt of it, sir.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DoRANTE: I want to settle this matter with you, and I came here to make
        up our accounts together.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: There wife! You see your impertinence!&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DORANTE: I am a man who likes to repay debts as soon as I can.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: <i>(Aside to Madame Jourdain)</i> I told you so.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DORANTE: Let's see how much do I owe you.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: <i>(Aside to Madame Jourdain)</i> There you are, with
        your ridiculous suspicions.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DORANTE: Do you remember well all the money you have lent me?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: I believe so. I made a little note of it. Here it is.
        Once you were given two hundred louis d'or.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DORANTE: That's true.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Another time, six-score.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DORANTE: Yes.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: And another time, a hundred and forty.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DORANTE: You're right.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: These three items make four hundred and sixty louis
        d'or, which comes to five thousand sixty livres.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DORANTE: The account is quite right. Five thousand sixty livres.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: One thousand eight hundred thirty-two livres to your
        plume-maker.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DORANTE: Exactly.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Two thousand seven hundred eighty livres to your
        tailor.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DoRANTE: It's true.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Four thousand three hundred seventy-nine livres
        twelve sols eight deniers to your tradesman.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DORANTE: Quite right. Twelve sols eight deniers. The account is exact.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: And one thousand seven hundred forty-eight livres
        seven sols four deniers to your saddler.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DORANTE: All that is true. What does that come to?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Sum total, fifteen thousand eight hundred livres.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DORANTE: The sum total is exact: fifteen thousand eight hundred livres.
        To which add two hundred pistoles that you are going to give me, which
        will make exactly eighteen thousand francs, which I shall pay you at the
        first opportunity.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MADAME JOURDAIN: <i>(Aside)</i> Well, didn't I predict it?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Peace!&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DORANTE: Will that inconvenience you, to give me the amount I say?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Oh, no!&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MADAME JOURDAIN: <i>(Aside)</i> That man is making a milk-cow out of
        you!&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Be quiet!&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DoRANTE: If that inconveniences you, I will seek it somewhere else.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: NO, Sir.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MADAME JOURDAIN: <i>(Aside)</i> He won't be content until he's ruined
        you.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Be quiet, I tell you.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DORANTE: You have only to tell me if that embarrasses you.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Not at all, sir.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MADAME JOURDAIN: <i>(Aside)</i> He's a real wheedler!&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Hush.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MADAME JOURDAIN: <i>(Aside)</i> He'll drain you to the last sou.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Will you be quiet?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DORANTE: I have a number of people who would gladly lend it to me; but
        since you are my best friend, I believed I might do you wrong if I asked
        someone else for it.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: It's too great an honor, sir, that you do me. I'll go
        get it for you.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MADAME JOURDAIN: <i>(Aside)</i> What! You're going to give it to him
        again?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: What can I do? Do you want me to refuse a man of this
        station, who spoke about me this morning in the King's bedchamber?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MADAME JOURDAIN: <i>(Aside)</i> Go on, you're a true dupe.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        SCENE V <i>(Dorante, Madame Jourdain, Nicole)</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        DORANTE: You appear to be very melancholy. What is wrong, Madame
        Jourdain?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MADAME JOURDAIN: I have a head bigger than my fist, even if it's not
        swollen.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DORANTE: Mademoiselle, your daughter, where is she that I don't see her?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MADAME JOURDAIN: Mademoiselle my daughter is right where she is.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DORANTE: How is she getting on?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MADAME JOURDAIN: She "gets on" on her two legs.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DORANTE: Wouldn't you like to come with her one of these days to see the
        ballet and the comedy they are putting on at court?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MADAME JOURDAIN: Yes truly, we have a great desire to laugh, a very
        great desire to laugh.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DORANTE: I think, Madame Jourdain, that you must have had many admirers
        in your youth, beautiful and good humored as you were.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MADAME JOURDAIN: By Our Lady! Sir, is Madame Jourdain decrepit, and does
        her head already shake with palsy?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DORANTE: Ah! My faith, Madame Jourdain, I beg pardon. I did not remember
        that you are young. I am often distracted. Pray excuse my impertinence.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        SCENE VI <i>(Monsieur Jourdain, Madame Jourdain, Dorante, Nicole)</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: There are two hundred louis d'or.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DORANTE: I assure you, Monsieur Jourdain, that I am completely yours,
        and that I am eager to render you a service at court.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: I'm much obliged to you.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DORANTE: If Madame Jourdain desires to see the royal entertainment, I
        will have the best places in the ballroom given to her.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MADAME JOURDAIN: Madame Jourdain kisses your hands [but declines].&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DORANTE: <i>(Aside to Monsieur Jourdain)</i> Our beautiful marchioness,
        as I sent word to you, in my note, will come here soon for the ballet
        and refreshments; I finally brought her to consent to the entertainment
        you wish to give her.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Let us move a little farther away, for a certain
        reason.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DORANTE: It has been eight days since I saw you, and I have sent you no
        news regarding the diamond you put into my hands to present to her on
        your behalf; but it's because I had the greatest difficulty in
        conquering her scruples, and it's only today that she resolved to accept
        it.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: How did she judge it?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DORANTE: Marvelous. And I am greatly deceived if the beauty of that
        diamond does not produce for you an admirable effect on her spirit.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Would to Heaven!&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MADAME JOURDAIN: <i>(To Nicole)</i> Once he's with him he cannot leave
        him.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DORANTE: I made her value as she should the richness of that present and
        the grandeur of your love.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: These are, sir, favors which overwhelm me; and I am
        in the very greatest confusion at seeing a person of your quality demean
        himself for me as you do.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DORANTE: Are you joking? Among friends, does one stop at these sorts of
        scruples? And wouldn't you do the same thing for me, if the occasion
        offered?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Oh! Certainly, and with all my heart.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MADAME JOURDAIN: <i>(To Nicole)</i> His presence weighs me down!&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DORANTE: As for me, I never mind anything when it is necessary to serve
        a friend; and when you confided in me about the ardent passion you have
        formed for that delightful marchioness with whom I have contacts, you
        saw that I volunteered immediately to assist your love.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: It's true, these are favors that confound me.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MADAME JOURDAIN: <i>(To Nicole)</i> Will he never go?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        NICOLE: They enjoy being together.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DORANTE: You took the right tack to touch her heart. Women love above
        all the expenses we go to for them; and your frequent serenades, your
        continual bouquets, that superb fireworks for her over the water, the
        diamond she has received from you, and the entertainment you are
        preparing for her, all this speaks much better in favor of your love
        than all the words you might have spoken yourself.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: There are no expenditures I would not make if by that
        means I might find the road to her heart. A woman of quality has
        ravishing charms for me and it's an honor I would purchase at any price.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MADAME JOURDAIN: <i>(To Nicole)</i> What can they talk about so much?
        Steal over and listen a little.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DORANTE: Soon enough you will enjoy at your ease the pleasure of seeing
        her, and your eyes will have a long time to satisfy themselves.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: To be completely free, I have arranged for my wife to
        go to dinner at her sister's, where she'll spend all the after-dinner
        hours.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DORANTE: You have done prudently, as your wife might have embarrassed
        us. I have given the necessary orders to the cook for you, and for the
        ballet. It is of my own invention; and, provided the execution
        corresponds to the idea, I am sure it will be found . . .&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN<i>: (Sees that Nicole is listening, and gives her a</i>
        <i>slap)</i> Say! You're very impertinent! <i>(To Dorante)</i> Let's go,
        if you please.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        SCENE VII <i>(Madame Jourdain, Nicole)</i>&nbsp;<i>&nbsp;</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        NICOLE: My faith, Madame, curiosity has cost me; but I believe
        something's afoot, since they were talking of some event where they did
        not want you to be.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MADAME JOURDAIN: Today's not the first time, Nicole, that I've had
        suspicions about my husband. I'm the most mistaken woman in the world,
        or there's some love-affair in the making. But let us see to my
        daughter. You know the love Cl&eacute;onte has for her. He's a man who
        appeals to me, and I want to help his suit and give him Lucile, if I
        can.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        NICOLE: Truly, Madame, I'm the most delighted creature in the world to
        see that you feel this way, since, if the master appeals to you, his
        valet appeals to me no less, and I could wish our marriage made under
        the shadow of theirs.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MADAME JOURDAIN: Go speak to Cl&eacute;onte about it for me, and tell
        him to come to me soon so we can present his request to my husband for
        my daughter in marriage.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        NICOLE: I hasten, Madame, with joy, for I could not receive a more
        agreeable commission. <i>(Alone)</i> I shall, I think, make them very
        happy.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        SCENE VIII <i>(Cl&eacute;onte, Covielle, Nicole)</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        NICOLE: Ah! I'm glad to have found you. I'm an ambassadress of joy, and
        I come . . .&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        CL&Eacute;ONTE: Get out, traitor, and don't come to amuse me with your
        treacherous words.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        NICOLE: Is this how you receive me . . .&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        CL&Eacute;ONTE: Get out, I tell you, and go tell your faithless mistress
        that she will never again in her life deceive the too trusting Cl&eacute;onte.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        NICOLE: What caprice is this? My dear Covielle, explain a little what
        you are trying to say.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        COVIELLE: Your dear Covielle, little hussy? Go, quickly, out of my
        sight, villainess , and leave me in peace.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        NICOLE: What! You come to me too. . .&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        COVIELLE: Out of my sight, I tell you, and never speak to me again.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        NICOLE: My word! What fly has bitten those two? Let's go tell this
        pretty story to my mistress.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        SCENE IX <i>(Cl&eacute;onte, Covielle)</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        CL&Eacute;ONTE: What! Treat a lover in this way? And a lover who is the
        most faithful and passionate of lovers?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        COVIELLE: It is a frightful thing that they have done to us both.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        CL&Eacute;ONTE: I show a woman all the ardor and tenderness that can be
        imagined; I love nothing in the world but her, and I have nothing but
        her in my thoughts; she is all I care for, all my desire, all my joy; I
        talk of nothing but her, I think of nothing but her, I have no dreams
        but of her, I breathe only because of her, my heart lives wholly in her;
        and see how so much love is well repaid! I have been two days without
        seeing her, which are for me two frightful centuries; I meet her by
        chance; my heart, at that sight, is completely transported, my joy
        shines on my face; I fly with ecstasy towards her -- and the faithless
        one averts her eyes and hurries by as if she had never seen me in her
        life!&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        COVIELLE: I say the same things as you.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        CL&Eacute;ONTE: Covielle, can one see anything to equal this perfidy of
        the ungrateful Lucile?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        COVIELLE: And that, Monsieur, of the treacherous Nicole?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        CL&Eacute;ONTE: After so many ardent homages, sighs, and vows that I
        have made to her charms!&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        COVIELLE: After so many assiduous compliments, cares, and services that
        I rendered her in the kitchen!&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        CL&Eacute;ONTE: So many tears I have shed at her knees!&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        COVIELLE: So many buckets of water I have drawn for her!&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        CL&Eacute;ONTE: So much passion I have shown her in loving her more than
        myself!&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        COVIELLE: So much heat I have endured in turning the spit for her!&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        CL&Eacute;ONTE: She flies from me in disdain!&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        COVIELLE: She turns her back on me!&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        CL&Eacute;ONTE: It is perfidy worthy of the greatest punishments.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        COVIELLE: It is treachery that merits a thousand slaps.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        CL&Eacute;ONTE: Don't think, I beg you, of ever speaking in her favor to
        me.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        COVIELLE: I, sir? God forbid!&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        CL&Eacute;ONTE: Never come to excuse the action of this faithless woman.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        COVIELLE: Have no fear.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        CLEONTE; No, you see, all your speeches in her defense will serve no
        purpose.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        COVIELLE: Who even thinks of that?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        CL&Eacute;ONTE: I want to conserve my resentment against her and end all
        contact with her.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        COVIELLE: I agree.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        CL&Eacute;ONTE: This Count who goes to her house is perhaps pleasant in
        her view; and her mind, I well see, allows itself to be dazzled by
        social standing. But it is necessary for me, for my honor, to prevent
        the scandal of her inconstancy. I want to break off with her first and
        not leave her all the glory of dumping me.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        COVIELLE: That's very well said, and I agree, for my part, with all your
        feelings.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        CL&Eacute;ONTE: Strengthen my resentment and aid my resolve against all
        the remains of love that could speak in her behalf. Tell me, I order
        you, all the bad you can of her; make for me a painting of her that will
        render her despicable; and show well, in order to disgust me, all the
        faults that you can see in her.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        COVIELLE: Her, sir? There's a pretty fool, a well made flirt for you to
        give so much love! I see only mediocrity in her, and you will find a
        hundred women who will be more worthy of you. First of all, she has
        small eyes.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        CL&Eacute;ONTE: That's true, she has small eyes; but they are full of
        fire, the brightest, the keenest in the world, the most touching eyes
        that one can see.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        COVIELLE: She has a big mouth.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        CL&Eacute;ONTE: Yes; but upon it one sees grace that one never sees on
        other mouths; and the sight of that mouth, which is the most attractive,
        the most amorous in the world, inspires desire.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        COVIELLE: As for her figure, she's not tall.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        CL&Eacute;ONTE: No, but she is graceful and well made.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        COVIELLE: She affects a nonchalance in her speech and in her actions.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        CL&Eacute;ONTE: That's true; but she may be forgiven all that, for her
        manners are so engaging, they have an irresistible charm.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        COVIELLE: As to her wit . . .&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        CL&Eacute;ONTE: Ah! She has that, Covielle, the finest, the most
        delicate!&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        COVIELLE: Her conversation . . .&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        CL&Eacute;ONTE: Her conversation is charming.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        COVIELLE: She is always serious . . .&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        CLEONTE; Would you have grinning playfulness, constant open merriment?
        And do you see anything more impertinent than those women who laugh all
        the time?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        COVIELLE: But finally she is as capricious as any woman in the world.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        CL&Eacute;ONTE: Yes, she is capricious, I concede; but everything
        becomes beautiful ladies well, one suffers everything for beauty.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        COVIELLE: I see clearly how it goes, you want to go on loving her.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        CL&Eacute;ONTE: Me, I'd like better to die; and I am going to hate her
        as much as I loved her.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        COVIELLE: How, if you find her so perfect?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        CL&Eacute;ONTE: That's how my vengeance will be more striking, in that
        way I'll show better the strength of my heart, by hating her, by
        quitting her, with all her beauty, all her charms, and as lovable as I
        find her. Here she is.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        SCENE X <i>(Cl&eacute;onte, Lucile, Covielle, Nicole)</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        NICOLE: For my part, I was completely shocked at it.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        LUCILE: It can only be, Nicole, what I told you. But there he is.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        CL&Eacute;ONTE: I don't even want to speak to her.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        COVIELLE: I'll imitate you.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        LUCILE: What's the matter Cl&eacute;onte? What's wrong with you?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        NICOLE: What's the matter with you, Covielle?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        LUCILE: What grief possesses you?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        NICOLE: What bad humor holds you?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        LUCILE: Are you mute, Cl&eacute;onte?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        NICOLE: Have you lost your voice, Covielle?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        CL&Eacute;ONTE: Is this not villainous!&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        COVIELLE: It's a Judas!&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        LUCILE: I clearly see that our recent meeting has troubled you.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        CL&Eacute;ONTE: Ah! Ah! She sees what she's done.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        NICOLE: Our greeting this morning has annoyed you.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        COVIELLE: She has guessed the problem.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        LUCILE: Isn't it true, Cl&eacute;onte, that this is the cause of your
        resentment?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        CL&Eacute;ONTE: Yes, perfidious one, it is, since I must speak; and I
        must tell that you shall not triumph in your faithlessness as you think,
        I want to be the first to break with you, and you won't have the
        advantage of driving me away. I will have difficulty in conquering the
        love I have for you; it will cause me pain; I will suffer for a while.
        But I'll come through it, and I would rather stab myself through the
        heart than have the weakness to return to you.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        COVIELLE: Me too.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        LUCILE: What an uproar over nothing. I want to tell you, Cl&eacute;onte,
        what made me avoid joining you this morning.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        CL&Eacute;ONTE: No, I don't want to listen to anything . . .&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        NICOLE: I want to tell you what made us pass so quickly.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        COVIELLE: I don't want to hear anything.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        LUCILE: <i>(Following Cl&eacute;onte)</i> Know that this morning . . .&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        CL&Eacute;ONTE: No, I tell you.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        NICOLE: <i>(Following Covielle)</i> Learn that . . .&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        COVIELLE: No, traitor.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        LUCILE: Listen.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        CL&Eacute;ONTE: I won't listen.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        NICOLE: Let me speak.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        COVIELLE: I'm deaf.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        LUCILE: Cl&eacute;onte!&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        CL&Eacute;ONTE: No.&nbsp;

      <p>
        NICOLE: Covielle!&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        COVIELLE: I won't listen.&nbsp;

      <p>
        LUCILE: Stop.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        CL&Eacute;ONTE: Gibberish!&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        NICOLE: Listen to me.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        COVIELLE: Rubbish!&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        LUCILE: One moment.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        CL&Eacute;ONTE: Never.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        NICOLE: A little patience.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        COVIELLE: Not interested!&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        LUCILE: Two words.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        CL&Eacute;ONTE: No, you've had them.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        NICOLE: One word.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        COVIELLE: No more talking.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        LUCILE: Alright! Since you don't want to listen to me, think what you
        like, and do what you want.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        NICOLE: Since you act like that, make whatever you like of it all.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        CL&Eacute;ONTE: Let us know the reason, then, for such a fine reception.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        LUCILE: It no longer pleases me to say.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        COVIELLE: Let us know something of your story.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        NICOLE: I, myself, no longer want to tell you.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        CL&Eacute;ONTE: Tell me . . .&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        LUCILE: No, I don't want to say anything.&nbsp;
      </p>

        COVIELLE: Tell it . . .&nbsp;

        NICOLE: No, I'll tell nothing.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        CL&Eacute;ONTE: For pity . . .&nbsp;

      <p>

      <p>
        CL&Eacute;ONTE: I beg you.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        LUCILE: Leave me . . .&nbsp;

      <p>

        CL&Eacute;ONTE: Clear up my doubts.&nbsp;

        NICOLE: No, I don't care to.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        CL&Eacute;ONTE: Alright! since you are so little concerned to take me
        out of my pain and to justify yourself for the shameful treatment you
        gave to my passion, you are seeing me, ingrate, for the last time, and I
        am going far from you to die of sorrow and love.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        COVIELLE: And I -- I will follow in his steps.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        LUCILE: Cl&eacute;onte!&nbsp;

      <p>

      <p>
        CL&Eacute;ONTE: What?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        COVIELLE: Yes?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        LUCILE: Where are you going?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        CL&Eacute;ONTE: Where I told you.&nbsp;

      <p>
        COVIELLE: We are going to die.&nbsp;

      <p>
        LUCILE: You are going to die, Cl&eacute;onte?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        CL&Eacute;ONTE: Yes, cruel one, since you wish it.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        LUCILE: Me! I wish you to die?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        CL&Eacute;ONTE: Yes, you wish it.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        LUCILE: Who told you that?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        CL&Eacute;ONTE: Is it not wishing it when you don't wish to clear up my
        suspicions?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        LUCILE: Is it my fault? And, if you had wished to listen to me, would I
        not have told you that the incident you complain of was caused this
        morning by the presence of an old aunt who insists that the mere
        approach of a man dishonors a woman -- an aunt who constantly delivers
        sermons to us on this text, and tells us that all men are like devils we
        must flee?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        NICOLE: There's the key to the entire affair.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        CL&Eacute;ONTE: Are you sure you're not deceiving me, Lucile?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        COVIELLE: Aren't you making this up?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        LUCILE: There's nothing more true.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        NICOLE: It's the absolute truth.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        COVIELLE: Are we going to give in to this?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        CL&Eacute;ONTE: Ah! Lucile, how with a word from your lips you are able
        to appease the things in my heart, and how easily one allows himself to
        be persuaded by the people one loves!&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        COVIELLE: How easily we are manipulated by these blasted minxes!&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        SCENE XI <i>(Madame Jourdain, Cl&eacute;onte, Lucile, Covielle, Nicole)</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        MADAME JOURDAIN: I am very glad to see you, Cl&eacute;onte and you are
        here at just the right time. My husband is coming, seize the opportunity
        to ask for Lucile in marriage.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        CL&Eacute;ONTE: Ah! Madame, how sweet that word is to me, and how it
        flatters my desires! Could I receive an order more charming, a favor
        more precious?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        SCENE XII <i>(Monsieur Jourdain, Madame Jourdain, Cl&eacute;onte,
        Lucile, Covielle,</i> <i>Nicole)</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        CL&Eacute;ONTE: Sir, I did not want to use anyone to make a request of
        you that I have long considered. It affects me enough for me to take
        charge of it myself; and, without further ado, I will say to you that
        the honor of being your son-in-law is a glorious favor that I beg you to
        grant me.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Before giving you a reply, sir, I beg to ask if you
        are a gentleman.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        CL&Eacute;ONTE: Sir, most people don't hesitate much over this question.
        They use the word carelessly. They take the name without scruple, and
        the usage of today seems to validate the theft. As for me, I confess to
        you, I have a little more delicate feelings on this matter. I find all
        imposture undignified for an honest man, and that there is cowardice in
        disguising what Heaven made us at birth; to present ourselves to the
        eyes of the world with a stolen title; to wish to give a false
        impression. I was born of parents who, without doubt, held honorable
        positions. I have six years of service in the army, and I find myself
        established well enough to maintain a tolerable rank in the world; but
        despite all that I certainly have no wish to give myself a name to which
        others in my place might believe they could pretend, and I will tell you
        frankly that I am not a gentleman.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Shake hands, Sir! My daughter is not for you.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        CL&Eacute;ONTE: What?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: You are not a gentleman. You will not have my
        daughter.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MADAME JOURDAIN: What are you trying to say with your talk of gentleman?
        Are we ourselves of the line of St. Louis?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Quiet, wife, I see what you are up to.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MADAME JOURDAIN: Aren't we both descended from good bourgeois families?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: There's that hateful word!&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MADAME JOURDAIN: And wasn't your father a merchant just like mine?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Plague take the woman! She never fails to do this! If
        your father was a merchant, so much the worse for him! But, as for mine,
        those who say that are misinformed. All that I have to say to you is,
        that I want a gentleman for a son-in-law.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MADAME JOURDAIN: It's necessary for your daughter to have a husband who
        is worthy of her, and it's better for her to have an honest rich man who
        is well made than an impoverished gentleman who is badly built.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        NICOLE: That's true. We have the son of a gentleman in our village who
        is the most ill formed and the greatest fool I have ever seen.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Hold your impertinent tongue! You always butt into
        the conversation. I have enough money for my daughter, I need only
        honor, and I want to make her a marchioness.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MADAME JOURDAIN: A marchioness?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Yes, marchioness.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MADAME JOURDAIN: Alas! God save me from it!&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: It's a thing I have resolved.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MADAME JOURDAIN: As for me, it's a thing I'll never consent to.
        Marriages above one's station are always subject to great
        inconveniences. I have absolutely no wish for a son-in-law who can
        reproach her parents to my daughter, and I don't want her to have
        children who will be ashamed to call me their grandmother. If she
        arrives to visit me in the equipage of a great lady and if she fails, by
        mischance, to greet someone of the neighborhood, they wouldn't fail
        immediately to say a hundred stupidities. "Do you see," they would say,
        "this madam marchioness who gives herself such glorious airs? It's the
        daughter of Monsieur Jourdain, who was all too glad, when she was
        little, to play house with us; she's not always been so haughty as she
        now is; and her two grandfathers sold cloth near St. Innocent's Gate.
        They amassed wealth for their children, they're paying dearly perhaps
        for it now in the other world, and one can scarcely get that rich by
        being honest." I certainly don't want all that gossip, and I want, in a
        word, a man who will be obliged to me for my daughter and to whom I can
        say, "Sit down there, my son-in-law, and have dinner with me."&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Surely those are the sentiments of a little spirit,
        to want to remain always in a base condition. Don't talk back to me: my
        daughter will be a marchioness in spite of everyone. And, if you make me
        angrier, I'll make a duchess of her.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MADAME JOURDAIN: Cl&eacute;onte, don't lose courage yet. Follow me, my
        daughter, and tell your father resolutely that, if you can't have him,
        you don't want to marry anyone.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        SCENE XIII <i>(Cl&eacute;onte, Covielle)</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        COVIELLE: You've made a fine business, with your pretty sentiments.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        CL&Eacute;ONTE: What do you want? I have a scruple about that which
        precedent cannot conquer.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        COVIELLE: Don't you make a fool of yourself by taking it seriously with
        a man like that? Don't you see that he is a fool? And would it cost you
        anything to accommodate yourself to his fantasies?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        CL&Eacute;ONTE: You're right. But I didn't believe it necessary to prove
        nobility in order to be Monsieur Jourdain's son-in-law.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        COVIELLE: Ha, ha, ha!&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        CL&Eacute;ONTE: What are you laughing at?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        COVIELLE: At a thought that just occurred to me of how to play our man a
        trick and help you obtain what you desire.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        CL&Eacute;ONTE: How?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        COVIELLE: The idea is really funny.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        CL&Eacute;ONTE: What is it?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        COVIELLE: A short time ago there was a certain masquerade which fits
        here better than anything, and that I intend to make part of a prank I
        want to play on our fool. It all seems a little phony; but, with him,
        one can try anything, there is hardly any reason to be subtle, and he is
        the man to play his role marvelously and to swallow easily any
        fabrication we want to tell him. I have the actors, I have the costumes
        ready, just leave it to me.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        CL&Eacute;ONTE: But tell me . . .&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        COVIELLE: I am going to instruct you in everything. Let's go, there he
        is, returning.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        SCENE XIV <i>(Monsieur Jourdain, Lackey)</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: What the devil is this? They have nothing other than
        the great lords to reproach me with, and as for me, I see nothing so
        fine as to associate with the great lords; there is only honor and
        civility among them, and I would have given two fingers of a hand to
        have been born a count or a marquis.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        LACKEY: Sir, here's the Count, and he has a lady with him.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: What! My Goodness, I have some orders to give. Tell
        them I'll be back here soon.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        SCENE XV <i>(Dorim&egrave;ne, Dorante, Lackey)</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        LACKEY: Monsieur says that he'll be here very soon.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DORANTE: That's fine.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DORIM&Egrave;NE: I don't know, Dorante; I feel strange allowing you to
        bring me to this house where I know no one.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DORANTE: Then where would you like, Madame, for me to express my love
        with an entertainment, since you will allow neither your house nor mine
        for fear of scandal?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DORIM&Egrave;NE: But you don't mention that every day I am gradually
        preparing myself to receive too great proofs of your passion? As good a
        defense as I have put up, you wear down my resistance, and you have a
        polite persistence which makes me come gently to whatever you like. The
        frequent visits began, declarations followed, after them came serenades
        and amusements in their train, and presents followed them. I withstood
        all that, but you don't give up at all and step by step you are
        overcoming my resolve. As for me, I can no longer answer for anything,
        and I believe that in the end you will bring me to marriage, which I
        have so far avoided.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DORANTE: My faith! Madame, you should already have come to it. You are a
        widow, and you answer only to yourself. I am my own master and I love
        you more than my life. Why shouldn't you be all my happiness from today
        onward?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DORIM&Egrave;NE: Goodness! Dorante, for two people to live happily
        together both of them need particular qualities; and two of the most
        reasonable persons in the world often have trouble making a union
        satisfactory to them both.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DORANTE: You're fooling yourself, Madame, to imagine so many
        difficulties, and the experience you had with one marriage doesn't
        determine anything for others.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DORIM&Egrave;NE: Finally I always come back to this. The expenses that I
        see you go to for me disturb me for two reasons: one is that they get me
        more involved than I would like; and the other is that I am sure --
        meaning no offense -- that you cannot do this without financially
        inconveniencing yourself, and I certainly don't want that.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DORANTE: Ah! Madame, they are trifles, and it isn't by that . . .&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DORIM&Egrave;NE: I know what I'm talking about; and among other gifts,
        the diamond you forced me to take is worth ...&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DORANTE: Oh! Madame, mercy, don't put any value on a thing that my love
        finds unworthy of you, and allow ... Here's the master of the house.&nbsp;

        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: <i>(After having made two bows, finding himself too</i>

      </p>
      <p>
        DORIM&Egrave;NE: What?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: One step, if you please.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DORIM&Egrave;NE: What is it?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Step back a little for the third.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DORANTE: Madame, Monsieur Jourdain is very knowledgeable.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Madame, it is a very great honor to me to be
        fortunate enough to be so happy as to have the joy that you should have
        had the goodness to accord me the graciousness of doing me the honor of
        honoring me with the favor of your presence; and, if I also had the
        merit to merit a merit such as yours, and if Heaven . . . envious of my
        luck . . . should have accorded me . . . the advantage of seeing me
        worthy . . . of the . . .&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DORANTE: Monsieur Jourdain, that is enough. Madame doesn't like grand
        compliments, and she knows that you are a man of wit<i>. (Aside</i> <i>to
        Dorim&egrave;ne)</i> As you can see, this good bourgeois is ridiculous
        enough in all his manners.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DORIM&Egrave;NE: It isn't difficult to see it.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DORANTE: Madame, he is the best of my friends.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: You do me too much honor.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DORANTE: A completely gallant man.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DORIM&Egrave;NE: I have great esteem for him.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: I have done nothing yet, Madame, to merit this favor.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DORANTE: <i>(Aside to Monsieur Jourdain)</i> Take care, nonetheless, to
        say absolutely nothing to her about the diamond that you gave her.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Can't I even ask her how she likes it?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DORANTE: What? Take care that you don't. That would be loutish of you;
        and, to act as a gallant man, you must act as though it were not you who
        made her this present. <i>(Aloud)</i> Monsieur Jourdain, Madame, says he
        is delighted to see you in his home.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DORIM&Egrave;NE: He honors me greatly.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: How obliged I am to you, sir, for speaking thus to
        her for me!&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DORANTE: I have had frightful trouble getting her to come here.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: I don't know how to thank you enough.&nbsp;
      </p>

        the world.&nbsp;

        SCENE I <i>(Dorim&egrave;ne, Monsieur Jourdain, Dorante, two Male
        Musicians,</i> <i>a Female Musician, Lackeys)</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        DORIM&Egrave;NE: Why, Dorante, that is really a magnificent repast!&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: You jest, Madame; I wish it were worthy of being
        offered to you. <i>(All sit at the table).</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        DORANTE: Monsieur Jourdain is right, Madame, to speak so, and he obliges
        me by making you so welcome. I agree with him that the repast is not
        worthy of you. Since it was I who ordered it, and since I do not have
        the accomplishments of our friends in this matter, you do not have here
        a very sophisticated meal, and you will find some incongruities in the
        combinations and some&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        barbarities of taste. If Damis, our friend, had been involved,
        everything would have been according to the rules; everything would have
        been elegant and appropriate, and he would not have failed to impress
        upon you the significance of all the dishes of the repast, and to make
        you see his expertise when it comes to good food; he would have told you
        about hearth-baked bread, with its golden brown crust, crunching
        tenderly between the teeth; of a smooth, full-bodied wine, fortified
        with a piquancy not too strong, of a loin of mutton improved with
        parsley, of a cut of specially-raised veal as long as this, white and
        delicate, and which is like an almond paste between the teeth, of
        partridges complimented by a surprisingly flavorful sauce, and, for his
        masterpiece, a soup accompanied by a fat young turkey surrounded by
        pigeons and crowned with white onions mixed with chicory. But, as for
        me, I declare my ignorance; and, as Monsieur Jourdain has said so well,
        I only wish that the repast were more worthy of being offered to you.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DORIM&Egrave;NE: I reply to this compliment only by eating.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Ah! What beautiful hands!&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DORIM&Egrave;NE: The hands are mediocre, Monsieur Jourdain; but you wish
        to speak of the diamond, which is very beautiful.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Me, Madame? God forbid that I should wish to speak of
        it; that would not be acting gallantly, and the diamond is a very small
        thing.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DORIM&Egrave;NE: You are very particular.&nbsp;

        DORANTE: What! Madame, what did you take Monsieur Jourdain for?&nbsp;

        DORANTE: He is a man who is always ready with a repartee. But don't you
        see that Monsieur Jourdain, Madame, eats all the pieces of food you have
        touched?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DORIM&Egrave;NE: I am captivated by Monsieur Jourdain . . .&nbsp;

        SCENE II <i>(Madame Jourdain, Monsieur Jourdain, Dorim&egrave;ne,
        Dorante,</i> <i>Musicians, Lackeys)</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        MADAME JOURDAIN: Aha! I find good company here, and I see that I was not
        expected. Was it for this pretty affair, Monsieur Husband, that you were
        so eager to send me to dinner at my sister's? I just saw stage
        decorations downstairs, and here I see a banquet fit for a wedding. That
        is how you spend your money, and this is how you entertain the ladies in
        my absence, and you give them music and entertainment while sending me
        on my way.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DORANTE: What are you saying, Madame Jourdain? And what fantasies are
        you getting into your head that your husband spends his money, and that
        it is he who is giving this entertainment to Madame? Please know that it
        is I; that he only lends me his house, and that you ought to think more
        about the things you say.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Yes, what impertinence. It is the Count who presents
        all this to Madame, who is a person of quality. He does me the honor of
        using my house and of wishing me to be with him.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MADAME JOURDAIN: All that's nonsense. I know what I know.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DORANTE: Come Madame Jourdain, put on better glasses.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MADAME JOURDAIN: I don't need glasses, sir, I see well enough; I have
        had suspicions for a long time, and I'm not a fool. This is very low of
        you, of a great lord, to lend a hand as you do to the follies of my
        husband. And you, Madame, for a great lady, it is neither fine nor
        honest of you to cause dissension in a household and to allow my husband
        to be in love with you.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DORIM&Egrave;NE: What is she trying to say with all this? Goodness
        Dorante! You have outdone yourself by exposing me to the absurd
        fantasies of this ridiculous woman.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DORANTE: Madame, wait! Madame, where are you going?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Madame! Monsieur Count, make excuses to her and try
        to bring her back. Ah! You impertinent creature, this is a fine way to
        act! You come and insult me in front of everybody, and you drive from me
        people of quality.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MADAME JOURDAIN: I laugh at their quality.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: I don't know who holds me back, evil creature, from
        breaking your head with the remains of the repast you came to disrupt.
        <i>(The table is removed).</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        MADAME JOURDAIN: <i>(Leaving)</i> I'm not concerned. These are my rights
        that I defend, and I'll have all wives on my side.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: You do well to avoid my rage. She arrived very
        inopportunely. I was in the mood to say pretty things, and I had never
        felt so witty. What's that?&nbsp;

      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: No, sir.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        COVIELLE: I saw you when you were no taller than that.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Me?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        COVIELLE: Yes. You were the most beautiful child in the world, and all
        the ladies took you in their arms to kiss you.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: To kiss me?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        COVIELLE: Yes, I was a great friend of your late father.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Of my late father?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        COVIELLE: Yes. He was a very honorable gentleman.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: What did you say?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        COVIELLE: I said that he was a very honorable gentleman.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: My father?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        COVIELLE: Yes.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: You knew him very well?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        COVIELLE: Assuredly.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: And you knew him as a gentleman?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        COVIELLE: Without doubt.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Then I don't know what is going on!&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        COVIELLE: What?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: There are some fools who want to tell me that he was
        a tradesman.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        COVIELLE: Him, a tradesman! It's pure slander, he never was one. All
        that he did was to be very obliging, very ready to help; and, since he
        was a connoisseur in cloth, he went all over to choose them, had them
        brought to his house, and gave them to his friends for money.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: I'm delighted to know you, so you can testify to the
        fact that my father was a gentleman.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        COVIELLE: I'll attest to it before all the world.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: You'll oblige me. What business brings you here?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        COVIELLE: Since knowing your late father, honorable gentleman, as I told
        you, I have traveled through all the world.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Through all the world!&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        COVIELLE: Yes.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: I imagine it's a long way from here to there.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        COVIELLE: Assuredly. I returned from all my long voyages only four days
        ago; and because of the interest I take in all that concerns you, I come
        to announce to you the best news in the world.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: What?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        COVIELLE: You know that the son of the Grand Turk is here?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Me? No.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        COVIELLE: What! He has a very magnificent retinue; everybody goes to see
        it, and he has been received in this country as an important lord.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: By my faith! I didn't know that.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        COVIELLE: The advantage to you in this is that he is in love with your
        daughter.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: The son of the Grand Turk?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        COVIELLE: Yes. And he wants to be your son-in-law.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: My son-in-law, the son of the Grand Turk?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        COVIELLE: The son of the Grand Turk your son-in-law. As I went to see
        him, and as I perfectly understand his language, he conversed with me;
        and, after some other discourse, he said to me<i>, "Acciam</i> <i>croc
        soler ouch alla moustaph gidelum amanahem varahini oussere</i> <i>carbulath,"</i>
        that is to say, "Haven't you seen a beautiful young person who is the
        daughter of Monsieur Jourdain, gentleman of Paris?"&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: The son of the Grand Turk said that of me?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        COVIELLE: Yes. Inasmuch as I told him in reply that I knew you
        particularly well and that I had seen your daughter: <i>"Ah!"</i> he
        said to me, <i>"marababa sahem;"</i> Which is to say, "Ah, how I am
        enamored of her!"&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN<i>: "Marababa sahem"</i> means "Ah, how I am enamored
        of her"?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        COVIELLE: Yes.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: By my faith, you do well to tell me, since, as for
        me, I would never have believed that <i>"marababa sahem"</i> could have
        meant to say "Oh, how I am enamored of her!" What an admirable language
        Turkish is!&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        COVIELLE: More admirable than one can believe. Do you know what <i>Cacaracamouchen</i>
        means?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: <i>Cacaracamouchen?</i> No.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        COVIELLE: It means: It means, "My dear soul."&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: <i>Cacaracamouchen</i> means "My dear soul?"&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        COVIELLE: Yes.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: That's marvelous! <i>Cacaracamouchen</i>, my dear
        soul. Who would have thought? I'm dumbfounded.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        COVIELLE: Finally, to complete my assignment, he comes to ask for your
        daughter in marriage; and in order to have a father-in-law who should be
        worthy of him, he wants to make you a <i>Mamamouchi</i>, which is a
        certain high rank in his country.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: <i>Mamamouchi?'</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        COVIELLE: Yes, <i>Mamamouchi</i>; that is to say, in our language, a
        Paladin. Paladin is one of those ancient . . . Well, Paladin! There is
        none nobler than that in the world, and you will be equal to the
        greatest lords of the earth.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: The son of the Grand Turk honors me greatly. Please
        take me to him in order to express my thanks.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        COVIELLE: What! He is going to come here.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: He's coming here?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        COVIELLE: Yes. And he is bringing everything for the ceremony of
        bestowing your rank.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: That seems very quick.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        COVIELLE: His love can suffer no delay.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: All that embarrasses me here is that my daughter is a
        stubborn one who has gotten into her head a certain Cleonte, and she
        swears she'll marry no one but him.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        COVIELLE: She'll change her mind when she sees the son of the Grand
        Turk; and then there is a remarkable coincidence here, it is that the
        son of the Grand Turk resembles this Cl&eacute;onte very closely. I just
        saw him, someone showed him to me; and the love she has for the one can
        easily pass to the other, and . . . I hear him coming. There he is.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        SCENE IV <i>(Cl&eacute;onte, as a Turk, with three Pages carrying his
        outer</i> <i>clothes, Monsieur Jourdain, Covielle, disguised.)</i>

      </p>
      <p>
        COVIELLE: That is to say: "Monsieur Jourdain, may your heart be all the
        year like a flowering rosebush." This is the way of speaking politely in
        those countries.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: I am the most humble servant of His Turkish Highness.&nbsp;

        wisdom of serpents."&nbsp;

      <p>
        COVIELLE: He says that you should go with him quickly to prepare
        yourself for the ceremony; then you can see your daughter and conclude
        the marriage.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: So many things in two words?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        COVIELLE: Yes; the Turkish language is like that, it says much in few
        words. Go quickly where he wants.&nbsp;

        had learned his role by heart, he could not have played it better. Ah!
        Ah! Excuse me, Sir, Wouldn't you like to help us here in an affair that
        is taking place.&nbsp;

        DORANTE: What?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        COVIELLE: I'll give you many chances, Sir, to guess the stratagem we are
        using on Monsieur Jourdain to get him to give his daughter to my master.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DORANTE: I can't begin to guess the stratagem, but I guess it will not
        fail in its effect, since you are undertaking it.&nbsp;

        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: <i>Mahometa-per-Jordina</i>.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MADAME JOURDAIN: What does that mean?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: <i>Jordina</i>, that is to say, Jourdain.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MADAME JOURDAIN: Very well, what of Jourdain?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: <i>Voler far un Paladina de Jordina</i>.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MADAME JOURDAIN: What?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: <i>Dar turbanta con galera</i>.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MADAME JOURDAIN: Which is to say what?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: <i>Per deffender Palestina</i>.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MADAME JOURDAIN: What are you trying to say?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: <i>Dara, dara, bastonnara</i>.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MADAME JOURDAIN: What jargon is this?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: <i>Non tener honta, questa star l'ultima affronta</i>.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MADAME JOURDAIN: What in the world is all that?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: <i>(Dancing and singing). Hou la ba, Ba la chou, ba</i>
        <i>la ba, ba la da.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        MADAME JOURDAIN: Alas! Oh Lord, my husband has gone mad.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: <i>(Leaving)</i> Peace, insolent woman! Show respect
        to the Monsieur Mamamouchi.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MADAME JOURDAIN: Has he lost his mind? I must hurry to stop him from
        going out. Ah! Ah! This is the last straw! I see nothing but shame on
        all sides.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>(She leaves.)</i>&nbsp;<i>&nbsp;</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        SCENE II <i>(Dorante, Dorim&egrave;ne)</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        DORANTE: Yes, Madame, you are going to see the most amusing thing
        imaginable. I don't believe it would be possible to find in all the
        world another man as crazy as that one is. And then too, Madame, we must
        try to help Cl&eacute;onte's plan by supporting his masquerade. He's a
        very gallant man and deserves our help.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DORIM&Egrave;NE: I think highly of him and he deserves happiness.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DORANTE: Besides that, we have here, Madame, another ballet performance
        that we shouldn't miss, and I want to see if my idea will succeed.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DORIM&Egrave;NE: I saw magnificent preparations, and I can no longer
        permit this Dorante. Yes, I finally want to end your extravagances and
        to stop all these expenses that I see you go to for me, I have decided
        to marry you right away. This is the truth of it, that all these sorts
        of things end with marriage, as you know.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DORANTE: Ah! Madame, is it possible that you should have taken such a
        sweet decision in my favor?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DORIM&Egrave;NE: It is only to impede you from ruining yourself; without
        that, I see very well that before long you would not have a penny.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DORANTE: How obliged I am to you, Madame, for the care you have to
        conserve my money! It is entirely yours, as well as my heart, and you
        may use them in whatever fashion you please.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DORIM&Egrave;NE: I'll make use of them both. But here is your man: his
        costume is wonderful.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        SCENE III <i>(Monsieur Jourdain, Dorante, Dorim&egrave;ne)</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        DORANTE: Sir, we come to pay homage, Madame and I, to your new dignity,
        and to rejoice with you at the marriage between your daughter and the
        son of the Grand Turk.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: <i>(After bowing in the Turkish way)</i> Sir, I wish
        you the strength of serpents and the wisdom of lions.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DORIM&Egrave;NE: I was very glad, Sir, to be among the first to come to
        congratulate you upon rising to such a high degree of honor.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Madame, I wish your rosebush to flower all year long;
        I am infinitely obliged to you for taking part in the honors bestowed
        upon me; and I am very happy to see you returned here, so I can make
        very humble excuses for the ridiculous behavior of my wife.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DORIM&Egrave;NE: That's nothing. I excuse her jumping to conclusions:
        your heart must be precious to her, and it isn't strange that the
        possession of such a man as you should inspire some jealousy.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: The possession of my heart is a thing that has been
        entirely gained by you.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DORANTE: You see, Madame, that Monsieur Jourdain is not one of those men
        that good fortune blinds, and that he still knows, even in his glory,
        how to recognize his friends.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DORIM&Egrave;NE: It is the mark of a completely generous soul.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DORANTE: Where then is His Turkish Highness? We want, as your friends,
        to pay him our respects.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: There he comes, and I have sent for my daughter in
        order to give him her hand.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        SCENE IV <i>(Cl&eacute;onte, Covielle, Monsieur Jourdain, etc.)</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        DORANTE: Sir, we come to bow to Your Highness as friends of the
        gentleman who is your father-in-law, and to assure you with respect of
        our very humble services.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Where's the interpreter to tell him who you are and
        to make him understand what you say? You will see that he will reply,
        and that he speaks Turkish marvelously. Hey there! Where the devil has
        he gone? <i>(To Cl&eacute;onte). Strouf, strif, strof, straf</i>. The
        gentleman is a <i>grande Segnore, grande Segnore, grande Segnore</i>.
        And Madame is a <i>Dama granda Dama, granda</i>. Ahi! He, Monsieur, he
        French <i>Mamamauchi</i>, and Madame also French <i>Mamamouchie</i>. I
        can't say it more clearly. Good, here's the interpreter. Where are you
        going? We won't know how to say anything without you. Tell him, that
        Monsieur and Madame are persons of high rank, who have come to pay their
        respects to him, as my friends, and to assure him of their services.
        You'll see how he will reply.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        COVIELLE: <i>Alabala crociam acci boram alabamen</i>.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        CL&Eacute;ONTE: <i>Catalequi tubal ourin soter amalouchan</i>.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: See?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        COVIELLE: He says that the rain of prosperity should water the garden of
        your family in all seasons.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: I told you that he speaks Turkish!&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DORANTE: That's wonderful.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        SCENE V <i>(Lucile, Monsieur Jourdain, Dorante, Dorim&egrave;ne, etc.)</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Come, my daughter; come here and give your hand to
        the gentleman who does you the honor of asking for you in marriage.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        LUCILE: What! Father, look at you! Are you playing in a comedy?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: No, no, this is not a comedy, it's a very serious
        matter, and as full of honor for you as possible. There is the husband I
        give you.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        LUCILE: To me, father?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Yes, to you. Come, put your hand in his, and give
        thanks to Heaven for your happiness.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        LUCILE: I have absolutely no wish to marry.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: I wish it, I, who am your father.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        LUCILLE: I'll do nothing of the sort.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Ah! What a nuisance! Come, I tell you. Give your
        hand.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        LUCILE: No, my father, I told you, there is no power on earth that can
        make me take any husband other than Cl&eacute;onte. And I will go to
        extreme measures rather than . . . <i>(Recognizes Cl&eacute;onte)</i> It
        is true that you are my father; I owe you complete obedience; and it is
        for you to dispose of me according to your wishes.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Ah! I am delighted to see you return so promptly to
        your duty, and it pleases me to have an obedient daughter.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        SCENE VI <i>(Madame Jourdain, Monsieur Jourdain, Cl&eacute;onte, etc.)</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        MADAME JOURDAIN: What now? What's this? They say that you want to give
        your daughter in marriage to a someone in a Carnival costume?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Will you be quiet, impertinent woman? You always
        throw your absurdities into everything, and there's no teaching you to
        be reasonable.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MADAME JOURDAIN: It's you that there is no way of making wise, and you
        go from folly to folly. What is your plan, and what do you want to do
        with this assemblage of people?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: I want to marry our daughter to the son of the Grand
        Turk.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MADAME JOURDAIN: To the son of the Grand Turk?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Yes. Greet him through the interpreter there.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MADAME JOURDAIN: I don't need an interpreter; and I'll tell him straight
        out myself, to his face, that there is no way he will have my daughter.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: I ask again, will you be quiet?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DORANTE: What! Madame Jourdain, do you oppose such good fortune as that?
        You refuse His Turkish Highness as your son-in-law?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MADAME JOURDAIN: My Goodness, Sir, mind your own business.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DORIM&Egrave;NE: It's a great glory, which is not to be rejected.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MADAME JOURDAIN: Madame, I beg you also not to concern yourself with
        what does not affect you.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DORANTE: It's the friendship we have for you that makes us involve
        ourselves in your interest.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MADAME JOURDAIN: I can get along quite well without your friendship.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DORANTE: Your daughter here agrees to the wishes of her father.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MADAME JOURDAIN: My daughter consents to marry a Turk?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DORANTE: Without doubt.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MADAME JOURDAIN: She can forget Cl&eacute;onte?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DORANTE: What wouldn't one do to be a great lady?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MADAME JOURDAIN: I would strangle her with my own hands if she did
        something like that.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: That is just so much talk. I tell you, this marriage
        shall take place.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MADAME JOURDAIN: And I say there is no way that it will happen.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Oh, what a row!&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        LUCILE: Mother!&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MADAME JOURDAIN: Go away, you are a hussy.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: What! You quarrel with her for obeying me?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MADAME JOURDAIN: Yes. She is mine as much as yours.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        COVIELLE: Madame!&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MADAME JOURDAIN: What do you want to tell me?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        COVIELLE: A word.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MADAME JOURDAIN: I want nothing to do with your word.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        COVIELLE: <i>(To Monsieur Jourdain)</i> Sir, if she will hear a word in
        private, I promise you to make her consent to what you want.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MADAME JOURDAIN: I will never consent to It.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        COVIELLE: Only listen to me.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MADAME JOURDAIN: No.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Listen to him.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MADAME JOURDAIN: No, I don't want to listen to him.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: He is going tell you . . .&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MADAME JOURDAIN: I don't want him to tell me anything whatsoever.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: There is the great stubbornness of a woman! How can
        it hurt you to listen to him?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        COVIELLE: Just listen to me; after that you can do as you please.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MADAME JOURDAIN: Alright! What?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        COVIELLE: <i>(Aside to Madame Jourdain)</i> For an hour, Madame, we've
        been signaling to you. Don't you see that all this is done only to
        accommodate ourselves to the fantasies of your husband, that we are
        fooling him under this disguise and that it is Cl&eacute;onte himself
        who is the son of the Grand Turk?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MADAME JOURDAIN: Ah! Ah!&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        COVIELLE: And I, Covielle, am the interpreter?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MADAME JOURDAIN: Ah! If this is the case then, I surrender.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        COVIELLE: Don't let on.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MADAME JOURDAIN: Yes, it's done, I agree to the marriage.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Ah! Now everyone's reasonable. You didn't want to
        hear it. I knew he would explain to you what it means to be the son of
        the Grand Turk.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MADAME JOURDAIN: He explained it to me very well, and I am satisfied.
        Let us send for a notary.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DORANTE: This is very well said. And finally, Madame Jourdain, in order
        to relieve your mind completely, and that you may lose today all the
        jealousy that you may have conceived of your husband, we shall have the
        same notary marry us, Madame and me.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MADAME JOURDAIN: I agree to that also.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Is this to make her believe our story?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DORANTE: <i>(Aside to Monsieur Jourdain)</i> It is necessary to amuse
        her with this pretence.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Good, good! Someone go for the notary.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        DORANTE: While we wait for him to come and while he draws up the
        contracts, let us see our ballet, and divert His Turkish Highness with
        it.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: That is very well advised. Come, let's take our
        places.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MADAME JOURDAIN: And Nicole?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: I give her to the interpreter; and my wife to whoever
        wants her.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        COVIELLE: Sir, I thank you. <i>(Aside)</i> If one can find a greater
        fool, I'll go to Rome to tell it.&nbsp;<i>&nbsp;</i>
      </p>

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

copied or distributed:

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1

to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
